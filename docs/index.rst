HBP Validation Framework - Python Client: Documentation
=======================================================

Quick Overview
==============
We discuss here some of the terms used in this documentation.

**Model**
   A Model or Model description consists of all the information pertaining to a
   model excluding details of the source code (i.e. implementation). The model
   would specify metadata describing the model type and its domain of utility.
   The source code is specified via the model instance (see below).

**Model Instance**
   This defines a particular version of a model by specifying the location of
   the source code for the model. A model may have multiple versions
   (model instances) which could vary, for example, in values of their
   biophysical parameters. Improvements and updates to a model would
   be considered as different versions (instances) of that particular model.

**Test**
   A Test or Test definition consists of all the information pertaining to a
   test excluding details of the source code (i.e. implementation). The test
   would specify metadata defining its domain of utility along with other info
   such as the type of data it handles and the type of score it generates.
   The source code is specified via the test instance (see below).

**Test Instance**
   This defines a particular version of a test by specifying the location of
   the source code for executing the test. A test may have multiple versions
   (test instances) which could vary, for example, in the way the simulation
   is setup or how the score is evaluated. Improvements in the test code would
   be considered as different versions (instances) of that particular test.

**sciunit**
   A Python package that handles of testing of models.
   For more, see: https://github.com/scidash/sciunit

**Result**
   The outcome of testing a specific model instance with a specific test
   instance. The result would consist of a score, and possibly additionally
   output files generated by the test.

More detailed tutorials will be published soon.
